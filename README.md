# 2016 California Presidential Primary Campaign Contributions

This project explores political donation trends from California during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries using real Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. It was completed as part of Week 12‚Äì13 of the **UC Berkeley MIDS DATASCI 200: Introduction to Data Science Programming** course.

## üìä Objectives
- Analyze real-world campaign finance data using `pandas`
- Visualize donation distributions with `matplotlib`
- Investigate patterns in candidate support and donor occupations

## üîç Dataset
The dataset used (`2016_ca_primary_cleaned.csv`) contains cleaned FEC data on campaign contributions from California during the 2016 presidential primary season. It is **not included** in the repo to avoid uploading large data files. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftdw7L9Z6WQJ6i0SXj030PA7ObsXfPsg/view?usp=sharing) and place it in a local directory outside the repository.

## üßÆ Analysis Topics
- Histograms of contribution amounts (full range & zoomed-in)
- Daily fundraising time series for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders
- Total vs. average donations by candidate
- Donor occupation analysis for each candidate

## üìÅ Files
- `fec_campaign_analysis.py` ‚Äî Main analysis script
